# Lessons Learned

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation on lessons learned from implementing various features and fixing issues. 

After finishing implementation, any major issues encountered, things that didn't work as expected, or insights gained during the process should be documented here. This helps in avoiding similar pitfalls in future projects and serves as a reference for best practices.
